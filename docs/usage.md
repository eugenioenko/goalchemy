# Using Goalchemy

Goalchemy compiles programs written in a restricted subset of Go into other languages. Source files are ordinary `.go` files: they build and run with the Go toolchain, and Goalchemy accepts the subset described in [the language specification](../specs/language.md). Release 0.1 supports the sequential language on two targets, lowered Go and TypeScript for Node.js. Run `goalchemy features` for the current feature matrix.

## Install

```sh
go build -o bin/goalchemy ./cmd/goalchemy
```

The repository's `go.mod` selects the Go 1.27.1 reference toolchain. Source programs must declare `go 1.25` or earlier. TypeScript output needs Node.js 22.6 or later, because it runs `.ts` files directly through Node's type stripping.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `goalchemy check [-gate g] [-tags t] [-json] [packages]` | Load, type-check, and validate against the language gate. |
| `goalchemy compile -target <go\|typescript\|ir> -out <dir> [packages]` | Write a complete, runnable target directory. |
| `goalchemy build [-config goalchemy.yaml]` | Compile every target listed in a project configuration. |
| `goalchemy run -target <name> [packages]` | Compile to a temporary directory and run the program. |
| `goalchemy features` | Print supported features and targets. |
| `goalchemy spec validate` / `spec generate [-check]` / `test` | Maintain and verify the runtime contract catalog. |

## Project configuration

`goalchemy build` reads `goalchemy.yaml` from the current directory:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
packages: [./cmd/app]      # package patterns, relative to this file
tags: [prod]               # optional build tags
gate: sequential           # sequential (default) or cooperative
targets:
  go: {out: out/go}
  typescript: {out: out/ts}
```

The file uses the same restricted YAML as the contract catalog: no anchors, aliases, or floats, and no unknown keys.

## Output

Each target directory contains the generated program, the runtime files it needs (one file per runtime function, plus shared representation files), a `README.md`, and `goalchemy.manifest.json`. The manifest records the source profile, compiler version, contract IDs, versions, and hashes, and every runtime and generated file. Output is deterministic for the same inputs.

- **Go**: `main.go`, `go.mod`, `rt/`. Run with `go run .`. Line directives map positions back to the Goalchemy source.
- **TypeScript**: `main.ts`, `main.ts.map`, `rt/`, `package.json`. Run with `node main.ts`, and add `--enable-source-maps` for source positions in stack traces.

Programs write output with Go's `print` and `println` builtins, which go to standard error. An unrecovered panic prints `panic: <value>` and exits with status 2, as Go does.

## What is rejected

`goalchemy check` reports unsupported constructs with stable codes (see [diagnostics](../specs/diagnostics.md)) and a one-line remedy. Release 0.1 rejects the following:

- generics, floating-point and complex numbers, and `uintptr`
- `unsafe`, cgo, `goto`, and range over functions
- pointers to slice or array elements, including pointer-receiver calls on elements
- concurrency, which waits for the cooperative gate
- imports other than module source and registered capabilities

The only registered standard-library capabilities are `errors.New`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.Unwrap`. `errors.As`, `errors.Join`, and `fmt` are not available.

## Behavior Go leaves open

Goalchemy fixes some behavior that Go leaves to the implementation. These choices are identical on every target:

- Map iteration follows insertion order. An entry deleted before it is visited is skipped, and entries inserted during iteration are not visited.
- When `append` exceeds capacity, the new capacity is `max(needed, max(1, 2*cap))`.
- `[]byte(s)` and `[]rune(s)` have capacity equal to their length.
- Operands are evaluated left to right wherever Go allows a choice.
